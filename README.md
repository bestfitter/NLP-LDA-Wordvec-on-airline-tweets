# NLP-LDA-Wordvec-on-airline-tweets
## An NLP (LDA & Word2Vec) trend analysis (topic modelling) exercise on Tweets sent by customer to different airlines

The data contains 146,000 tweets by customers to 6 different airlines' support tweet hashtag on various topics. The data is already categorized by various criterion e.g. 'positive', 'negative', 'neural' sentiment, or by issue type, 'luggage', 'reservation', 'late'. etc.

However, I will only be using the 'text' field containing the customer's text, perform unsupervised training and identify the trends/issues/topics.

#### Potential business uses:
- A weekly report to airline's executive mgmt indicating the trends/issues in complaint data (from twitter channel)
- A dialog system (chatbot)
- Redirect, classify and summarize complaint/inquiry text from airline's support pages

### Objective: To quickly train an LDA model on the 'text' field and identify trends/topics/sentiment.

#### Data: The data file 'Tweets.csv' can be downloaded from Kaggle [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment#Tweets.csv)
